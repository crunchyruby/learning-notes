# Machine Learning Learning Notes - 2025-04-09

## Summary

Today I learned about supervised learning. This is important because it's a fundamental concept in Machine Learning development.

## Key Concepts

1. **Supervised Learning Basics**: The core principles of supervised learning and how they work.
2. **Advanced Supervised Learning Techniques**: More advanced techniques for using supervised learning effectively.
3. **Supervised Learning Best Practices**: Best practices to follow when working with supervised learning.

## Code Examples

```javascript
function exampleFunction(param1, param2) {
  /**
   * This is an example function that demonstrates {0}.
   *
   * @param {number} param1 - The first parameter
   * @param {number} param2 - The second parameter
   * @returns {number} The result of the operation
   */
  const result = param1 + param2;
  return result;
}

/** Example usage

```
