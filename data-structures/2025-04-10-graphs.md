# Data Structures Learning Notes - 2025-04-10

## Summary

Today I learned about graphs. This is important because it's a fundamental concept in Data Structures development.

## Key Concepts

1. **Graphs Basics**: The core principles of graphs and how they work.
2. **Advanced Graphs Techniques**: More advanced techniques for using graphs effectively.
3. **Graphs Best Practices**: Best practices to follow when working with graphs.

## Code Examples

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    This is an example function that demonstrates {0}.
    
    Args:
        param1: The first parameter
        param2: The second parameter
        
    Returns:
        The result of the operation
    """
    result = param1 + param2
    return result
```
