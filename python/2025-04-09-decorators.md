## Summary

Today I learned about decorators. This is important because it's a fundamental concept in Python development.

## Key Concepts

1. **Decorators Basics**: The core principles of decorators and how they work.
2. **Advanced Decorators Techniques**: More advanced techniques for using decorators effectively.
3. **Decorators Best Practices**: Best practices to follow when working with decorators.

## Code Examples

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    This is an example function that demonstrates {0}.
    
    Args:
        param1: The first parameter
        param2: The second parameter
        
    Returns:
        The result of the operation
    """
    result = param1 + param2
    return result
```
